Step 1.
    [12, 25, 37, 18, 42, 55, 29, 61, 34, 45, 50, 41, 39, 33]

    The sums/averages of the groups of ten:
    358/35.8
    396/39.6
    412/41.2
    414/41.4
    429/42.9

Step 2.
    To find the highest average sub-array of size 10, I will use a sliding window technique. First, I will compute the sum of the first 10 elements. Then, I will slide the window by removing the first element of the previous sub-array and adding the next element in the list. I will keep track of the maximum sum encountered and calculate the highest average by dividing the max sum by 10.

Step 3.
    FUNCTION find_max_average(array, k):
        Initialize max_sum and current_sum to 0
        Compute the sum of the first k elements and store it in current_sum
        Set max_sum to current_sum
        
        FOR i FROM k TO length of array - 1:
            Subtract array[i - k] from current_sum (remove the leftmost element)
            Add array[i] to current_sum (add the new element)
            Update max_sum if current_sum is greater
        
        RETURN max_sum / k

Step 4.
    // Function to find the highest average sub-array of size 10
    function findHighestAverageSubArray(arr):
    if length(arr) < 10:
        return "Array is too small"

    // Compute the sum of the first 10 elements
    currentSum = 0
    for i = 0 to 9:
        currentSum = currentSum + arr[i]

    // Initialize maxSum with the sum of the first sub-array
    maxSum = currentSum

    // Slide the window through the array
    for i = 10 to length(arr) - 1:
        currentSum = currentSum - arr[i - 10] + arr[i]
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)

    // Calculate and return the highest average
    highestAverage = maxSum / 10
    return highestAverage

Step 5:
    My pseudocode:
    Pros:
        My pseudocode is clear, compact, and concise.  It minimizes the number of computations and focuses solely on the core logic.
    Cons:
        It doesn't account for any edge cases or arrays that are too small to form a valid sub-array.
    Copilot's pseudocode:
    Pros:
        It has more descriptive variable names and handles errors better, checking whether the array is the right size or not.
    Cons:
        It's more detailed than necessary and the checks for length could be seen as redundant.
    My Improvement
        Mine can double check and validate the length of the array. 
    Copilot's Improvement  
        Instead of using a loop for the sum, you can just use the built-in sum operator in Python to improve efficiency.
    Step 4 match Step 1
    Yes it matches

Step 6.
    FUNCTION find_max_average(array, k):
        IF length(array) < k:
            RETURN "Array is too small"

        Initialize current_sum to sum of first k elements
        Initialize max_sum to current_sum

        FOR i FROM k TO length of array - 1:
            Subtract array[i - k] from current_sum (remove the leftmost element)
            Add array[i] to current_sum (add the new element)
            Update max_sum if current_sum is greater than max_sum

        RETURN max_sum / k

Step 7.
    Label   current_sum max_sum i	sub-array (window)
    A       165     	165	    N/A	[41, 45, 47, 32]
    B	    165	        165	    N/A	[41, 45, 47, 32]
    C	    165	        165	    4	[45, 47, 32, 49]
    D	    173	        173	    4	[45, 47, 32, 49]
    E	    168     	173	    5	[47, 32, 49, 40]
    F	    168	        173	    5	[47, 32, 49, 40]
    G	    153	        173	    6	[32, 49, 40, 32]
    H	    153	        173	    6	[32, 49, 40, 32]
    I	    173	        173	    N/A	N/A
